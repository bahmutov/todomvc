## Install

    npm i -S node-sentry-error-reporter

## Use

The goal is to have zero configuration reporter that handles global or app's errors
automatically.

Set environment variable `SENTRY_URL` if you need exception reporting.
Then just require the module and pass (if needed) a server object, for example an Express app.

```js
const reporter = require('node-sentry-error-reporter')
reporter()
// or if inside Express app
const app = express()
reporter(app)
```

If `NODE_ENV` is 'production' the errors will be forwarded to the Sentry server,
otherwise just printed to the console error stream.

## Report an error

The module returns a function you can use to report instances of error.

```js
const init = require('node-sentry-error-reporter')
const report = init()
report(new Error('something went wrong'))
```

The function `init` is memoized, thus you can call it from multiple modules, and it will
only init once.

You can pass additional details object after the error

```js
report(new Error('something went wrong'), {foo: 42})
```

## Release / version

This package tries to send "release" or "version" string with each error.
It is looked up from the environment settings under `VERSION`, `RELEASE`, etc. names,
or if not found, from the current folder's `package.json`. 
See [src/find-version.js](src/find-version.js) source file.

## How to exit

If you are reporting an error and then exiting the Node process, you need to give the reporter
enough time to make HTTP post to the crash server. I would recommend at least 1 second delay.

```js
somethingFails()
  .catch((error) => {
      reportError(error, {other: details})
      setTimeout(() => process.exit(-1), 1000)
    }
  })
```
